# Robotframework - Sauce Labs Plugin

This is a plugin for the SeleniumLibrary to help with using Sauce Labs. 

This library is a [plugin extension]() of the SeleniumLibrary. That means you can (in theory!) use all the keywords in the SeleniumLibrary _in addition to_ the keywords added here. The keywords added are specifically meant for use with Sauce Labs.

## Installation

You can install this package using `pip`: 

```bash
pip install robotframework-saucelabs
```

Note that you must have the SeleniumLibrary installed as well. 

## Examples

See [the acceptance test](./atest/acceptance.robot) for an example of usage, and the other tests for more examples. 

## Contribution

Contributors welcome! We need keywords, and if you are a robot and Sauce Labs user, please open pull requests and/or issues as needed!
